**************************
**CODE COMMIT TEMPLATES:**
**************************

**Project name qualifier for the heading of code commit messages for projects that have multiple applications/modules in one repository that use the same database**
**[APPLICATION NAME] is the name of the given application/module that was updated in the code commit**
**[SHORT DESCRIPTION] is the short description of the type of code commit (e.g. database upgrade, documentation update, new functionality, etc.)**
--[APPLICATION NAME]: [SHORT DESCRIPTION]--


**Heading that can be used to define which version of the database was used in a given code commit message:**
**[MAJOR].[MINOR] is the major/minor version of the database where [MAJOR] is the major version of the database and [MINOR] is the minor version of the database, both the major and minor version values are integers starting from zero that are incremented by one without a leading zero.  The exception to the rule is that the first version of a database should be 0.1.  Otherwise when each major version is incremented the minor version should be reset to 0 for that major version (e.g. version 3.0).**
(this version uses version [MAJOR].[MINOR] of the database)


**Heading that can be used to define which version of the database was defined and used in a given code commit message:**
**[MAJOR].[MINOR] is the major/minor version of the database where [MAJOR] is the major version of the database and [MINOR] is the minor version of the database, both the major and minor version values are integers starting from zero that are incremented by one without a leading zero.**
(this version defines and uses version [MAJOR].[MINOR] of the database)


*******************************
**DATABASE UPGRADE TEMPLATES:**
*******************************

**Template for database project information for inclusion at the top of every SQL DDL/DML file:**
**[DATABASE NAME] is the name of the database that is being upgraded, the name can contain spaces and capitalizations**
**[DATABASE DESCRIPTION] is a brief general description of what the database represents and what it is used for**
--------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------
--Database Name: [DATABASE NAME]
--Database Description: [DATABASE DESCRIPTION]
--------------------------------------------------------

**Heading for the combined DDL/DML file:**
--------------------------------------------------------
--Combined DDL/DML file:
--------------------------------------------------------


**Heading for a given database version's upgrade SQL statements**
**[MAJOR].[MINOR] is the major/minor version of the database where [MAJOR] is the major version of the database and [MINOR] is the minor version of the database, both the major and minor version values are integers starting from zero that are incremented by one without a leading zero.  The exception to the rule is that the first version of a database should be 0.1.  Otherwise when each major version is incremented the minor version should be reset to 0 for that major version (e.g. version 3.0).**

--version [MAJOR].[MINOR] updates:
--------------------------------------------------------


**database upgrade log entry**
**[DATABASE NAME] is the name of the database that is being upgraded, the name can contain spaces and capitalizations**
**[MAJOR].[MINOR] is the major/minor version of the database where [MAJOR] is the major version of the database and [MINOR] is the minor version of the database, both the major and minor version values are integers starting from zero that are incremented by one without a leading zero.  The exception to the rule is that the first version of a database should be 0.1.  Otherwise when each major version is incremented the minor version should be reset to 0 for that major version (e.g. version 3.0).**
**[UPGRADE DATE] is the date the upgrade was committed to version control in DD-MON-YY format**
**[UPGRADE DESCRIPTION] is the description of the database upgrade that was developed**
--define the upgrade version in the database upgrade log table:
INSERT INTO DB_UPGRADE_LOGS (UPGRADE_APP_NAME, UPGRADE_VERSION, UPGRADE_DATE, UPGRADE_DESC) VALUES ('[DATABASE NAME]', '[MAJOR].[MINOR]', TO_DATE('[UPGRADE_DATE]', 'DD-MON-YY'), '[UPGRADE DESCRIPTION]');
